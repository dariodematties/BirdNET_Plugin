# Avian diversity monitoring on the edge

This is an autonomous avian diversity monitoring by sounds taken from microphones located in natural areas.

This project will allow the determination of avian biodiversity autonomously through the use of machine learning by placing microphones in specific forest locations. Consequently it will be possible to get exposure to many different organisms occupying such areas without needing to detect them during demanding and expensive human fieldwork.
To that end we are using a DNN, called BirdNET, which is designed to identify 984 North American and European bird species by sound. The model architecture is derived from the family of residual networks (ResNets), consists of 157 layers with more than 27 million paÂ­
rameters, and was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup [1].
